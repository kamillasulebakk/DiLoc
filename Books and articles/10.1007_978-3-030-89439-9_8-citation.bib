abstract="Measurements of electric potentials from neural activity have played a key role in neuroscience for almost a century, and simulations of neural activity is an important tool for understanding such measurements. Volume conductor (VC) theory is used to compute extracellular electric potentials stemming from neural activity, such as extracellular spikes, multi-unit activity (MUA), local field potentials (LFP), electrocorticography (ECoG), and electroencephalography (EEG). Further, VC theory is also used inversely to reconstruct neuronal current source distributions from recorded potentials through current source density methods. In this book chapter, we show how VC theory can be derived from a detailed electrodiffusive theory for ion concentration dynamics in the extracellular medium, and we show what assumptions must be introduced to get the VC theory on the simplified form that is commonly used by neuroscientists. Furthermore, we provide examples of how the theory is applied to compute spikes, LFP signals, and EEG signals generated by neurons and neuronal populations.",
