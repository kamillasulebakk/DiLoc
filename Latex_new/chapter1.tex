\chapter{Introduction to Neuroscience}
% Source for the first sentence ?
Neuroscience is a multidisciplinary field focused on understanding the complexities of the human brain and nervous system. At its core, neuronal communication forms the foundation for brain function, where billions of neurons interact through electrical signals called action potentials. Electroencephalography (EEG) plays a pivotal role in this area by recording and analyzing these electrical potentials in the brain. EEG serves as a non-invasive tool to detect abnormal brain activity and identify neurological disorders such as epilepsy. By exploring electrical brain activity, neuroscience aim to advance our comprehension of the human brain and improve diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for various neurological conditions.

In this introductory chapter, we will delve into the foundational aspects of neuronal communication, which will be usefull in chapter 2, where we will explore the principles of EEG recordings. By familiarizing ourselves with the fundamental concepts of neurons, we hope to gain a deeper understanding of the applications of EEG in the dynamic field of neuroscience. The chapter is based on the books "Neuronal Dynamics" by Gerstner, Kistler, Naud, and Paninski \cite{gerstner2014neuronal} and "Principles of Computational Modelling in Neuroscience" by Sterratt, Graham, Gillies, and Willshaw \cite{sterratt2011principles}.

\section{The Neuron}

Neurons are the fundamental units of the central nervous system, forming intricate networks with numerous interconnections. Similar to other cells, neurons have a voltage difference across their cell membrane known as the membrane potential. This membrane potential is a result of the selective permeability of the cell membrane to different ions, particularly sodium (Na+), calcium (Ca2+), and chloride (Cl-). At rest, the neuron maintains a relatively higher concentration of sodium ions outside the cell and a higher concentration of potassium ions inside the cell. This difference in ion concentrations, along with the presence of ion channels that regulate the flow of ions in and out of the cell, contributes to the resting membrane potential. Typically, the membrane potential of a neuron hovers around -65 mV, indicating that the interior of the cell is negatively charged compared to the external environment \cite{sterratt2011principles}.

A neuron consists of three distinct parts: the \emph{dendrites}, the \emph{soma}, and the \emph{axon}. Dendrites, with their branching structure, play an important role in collecting signals from other neurons. These signals are transmitted to the soma, which acts as the central processing unit, performing essential nonlinear processing. If the total input received by the soma reaches a specific threshold, an \emph{action potential} is initiated. This signal generates an electrical current that travels along the axon, leading to the release of \emph{neurotransmitters}. These neurotransmitters diffuse across the junction, also knows as the synapse, between the sending and receiving neuron. If the receptors on the receiving neuron accept the neurotransmitters, a new electrical signal is generated. This transmission of signals between neurons at specialized junctions is called \emph{synaptic input} \cite{gerstner2014neuronal}.

In Figure \ref{fig:neuron}, we have provided a basic illustration of a single neuron with dendrites, soma, and axon.

\section{Spike Trains and Action Potentials}
\rednote{Shold I write about Depolarization, Repolarization and Refractory period?}

When the electrical signals transmitted towards the soma reach the so-called threshold value, usually around -55 mV, the neuron fires. This initiation of an action potential can be seen as a spike in electrical recordings, with an amplitude of about 100 mV and a duration of 1-2 ms \cite{gerstner2014neuronal}. In Figure \ref{fig:action_potential} we have provided an illustration of the typical action potential.

    \label{fig:action_potential}
\end{figure}

The action potential is characterised by a swift and steep rise in the electrical potential, resulting in a rapid upward, positive spike, followed by a quick decline in the potential back to the resting state. This form of the action potentials remains relatively constant throughout the propagation along the axon. When collecting information out of these spikes, it is therefor not the shape of the spikes that is studied. Instead, the information lies in the number and timing of chains of action potentials emmitted by the neuron, also reffered to as \emph{spike trais}.

Spike trains observed during epileptic seizures exhibit distinguishable characteristics compared to "normal" spike trains in regular neural activity. Epileptic seizures are characterized by regular, symmetrical, and generalized EEG patterns known as spike-and-wave discharges. These discharges result from bilateral synchronous firing of neurons within the thalamocortical network \cite{wiki:electroencephalography}. The spike-and-wave discharges manifest as a repetitive and rhythmic pattern, typically around 2.5 Hz or higher, setting them apart from the more irregular and unpredictable firing of action potentials seen in spike trains from healthy patients \cite{gerstner2014neuronal}. During epileptic events, the initiation of these discharges involves complex mechanisms, including the interplay of voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels and the role of inhibitory postsynaptic potentials \cite{wiki:electroencephalography}.
%This stark contrast in the rhythmicity and temporal dynamics of epileptic spike trains highlights the distinct nature of epileptic activity when compared to the more variable and less periodic patterns observed in "normal" neuronal firing \cite{gerstner2014neuronal}.

% Need to be rewritten somehow.
% The hypersynchronous discharges that occur during a seizure may begin in a very discrete region of cortex and then spread to neighboring regions. Seizure initiation is characterized by two concurrent events: 1) high-frequency bursts of action potentials, and 2) hypersynchronization of a neuronal population. The synchronized bursts from a sufficient number of neurons result in a so-called spike discharge on the EEG. At the level of single neurons, epileptiform activity consists of sustained neuronal depolarization resulting in a burst of action potentials, a plateau-like depolarization associated with completion of the action potential burst, and then a rapid repolarization followed by hyperpolarization. This sequence is called the paroxysmal depolarizing shift. (Slide 23) The bursting activity resulting from the relatively prolonged depolarization of the neuronal membrane is due to influx of extracellular Ca++, which leads to the opening of voltage-dependent Na+ channels, influx of Na+, and generation of repetitive action potentials. The subsequent hyperpolarizing afterpotential is mediated by GABA receptors and Clâˆ’ influx, or by K+ efflux, depending on the cell type.

\section{Anatomy of the Cortex}
% Taken from the book and need to be rewritten !
Neurons in the brain are part of a vast network, interwoven with billions of other neurons and glial cells, creating the complex brain tissue. The brain is divided into various regions, and one essential area is the cortex, a thin but expansive sheet of neurons that folds over other brain structures. Different cortical areas have specific roles; some are specialized in processing sensory information, while others handle working memory or control motor functions \cite{gerstner2014neuronal}.

The human cerebral cortex consists of up to six layers of neurons. The oldest part of the cortex, known as the archipallium, has a more straightforward structure with three distinct neuronal layers. Within the archipallium, the hippocampus plays a major role in learning and memory functions. It is a crucial cortical structure implicated in the development of some common epilepsy syndromes \cite{bromfield2006introduction}.

Neurons communicate through synapses, where \emph{presynaptic neurons} sends, and \emph{postsynaptic cells} receives the information. In the animal brain, a single presynaptic neuron can connect to over 10,000 postsynaptic neurons. While many axonal branches end close to the neuron itself, some axons extend several centimeters to reach neurons in other brain regions \cite{gerstner2014neuronal}.

Within the cortex, there are two primary classes of neurons. Pyramidal neurons send information to distant areas of the brain, and they play a crucial role in long-distance communication. On the other hand, basket cells are considered local-circuit neurons, exerting their influence on nearby neurons. Most principal neurons form excitatory synapses, meaning they stimulate post-synaptic neurons, while most basket neurons form inhibitory synapses, meaning they suppress the activity of principal cells or other inhibitory neurons \cite{bromfield2006introduction}.
